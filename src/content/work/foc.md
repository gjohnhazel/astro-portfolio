### Building a Premium Retreat & Membership Platform

#### Project Overview
Founders Only Club needed a complete digital build that reflected the premium nature of its 48-hour founders retreats and ongoing membership community. I developed the site from the ground up in Shopify, ensuring the brand felt elevated, trustworthy, and conversion-ready.

#### Key Contributions
- **Full Shopify build** including theme structure, UX, and content architecture  
- **Retreat registration flows** with tiered pricing, event details, and conversion-optimized CTAs  
- **Membership system** for Lite and Premium plans, including gated content and access pathways  
- **Brand storytelling** across the homepage, retreat pages, and member benefits  
- **Performance and SEO setup** to support growth and organic reach  

#### Impact
The site became the central engine for retreat sales, membership growth, and sponsor partnerships. It communicates clarity, credibility, and community, helping founders instantly understand the value of FOC and take action.
