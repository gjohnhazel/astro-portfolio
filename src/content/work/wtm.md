### Launching a National Fitness Movement Online

#### Project Overview
The World’s Toughest Mile needed a bold, high-energy website to introduce its nationwide tour and signature four-lap challenge. I developed the site in WordPress, blending brand, storytelling, and event logistics into a cohesive digital experience.

#### Key Contributions
- **Elementor theme design** for speed, flexibility, and brand precision
- **Race finder interface** for the multi-city tour  
- **Challenge explanation modules** showcasing all four laps and movements  
- **Wellness festival programming** including recovery zones, workshops, and community experiences  
- **Event detail templates** supporting recurring locations, pricing, and ticket links  

#### Impact
The website positioned WTM as a legitimate fitness movement, not just a race. It enabled clear event discovery, increased ticket conversions, and supported PR momentum as the challenge expanded into new cities.
